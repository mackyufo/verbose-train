 it. I don’t know if it’s a good idea, in the light of what we just talked about, but… something inside me feels that it would be… really bad for him. Bad for Agnes, in particular.

MELANIE
You wouldn’t believe me.

MARTIN
I think we both see in him a bit of ourselves. Certainly we feel a bit like him. We both think we saw ourselves as heirs to that house, so to speak. Not literally, of course, but it’s ours and we feel it, that we’ve watched it grow, and it’s ours. The more things change, the more certain patterns they leave in its wake.

So we came here to try and find that elusive balance, poke and prod and prod until our eyeballs bleed. To no avail. Sometimes those patterns stay the same, shifting and intervening between ourselves, while at other times they become identical. When we first met Michael, he was the one who told us of course. I had never heard of him before, and had no idea of what I’d do, but from that first moment, we became something very different.

He was tall, maybe six and a half feet? With long, curly, dark hair that fell over his eyes, and deep bruising black eyes, Michael was. At first, I thought he was a tax accountant, raising accounts with low-level waste companies. After a few minutes I realised that it was likely the accountant, and not Michael, was the one that had put the nail in the coffin.

After a while, I began to notice a… a different pattern emerging. Whenever he was walking down the stairs, whenever we were located at the same place, whichever of the two floors he was on, and it crumbled, and popped, like a pancake when I hit it. I never went down a flight of stairs at the same time twice. It was a worrying little pattern, but it often led to harmless treats or small errands. It was not, however, long enough to send me spiralling messily out of my skin.

Finally, I resolved to find a solution that did not involve throwing myself out of a window. It required some deft hand-eye coordination, but soon enough it merely required following a well-choreographed route, with my chosen route of choice serving as a guide. Without my own plan of action, it was simply a matter of following my own path home.

Initially, it seemed harmless enough. I played with a small rash, ate a few meals, and generally seemed to feel better. It was the television that seemed to make me ill, though. Especially daytime television, as it provided me a backdrop for wandering around for an hour at a time. I found myself watching American television, mostly comedies about people eating, and generally lacking in interest. It was the constant feeling of being watched that I was always afraid of.

As time went on, however, it became quite alarming. Whenever I watched American television, whenever I had free access to the diversion that was America, I would instantly be whisked away to this nation’s peril. I would arrive at the John F. Kennedy international airport, I would be led through customs and further security procedures, and as soon as I stepped out of the car, I would be met by my savior: the rector of St. Mark’s church.

He would lead me through the rest of the country by a fascinating train of thought, and explain to me the principles of how it was he hoped to use this unique combination of old and modern technologies to his own nefarious ends.

It was not a complete shock, then, to discover that my benefactor was none other than Nikola LUKAS. The doors between our worlds were so strong, sometimes I remember the seams in them where it seemed the fabric or wood of the cover was stronger than the steel or glass of the door.

I once tried to tell myself that it was just the mind getting stronger, but it pushed me further into madness than any physical impairment.

When I finally lost my passport in mid-November, I made the decision to attempt to break into the Eternal City through the newly built Great Pyramid of Giza. I had found many articles and accounts of incredible riches hidden within the complex, some only-slightly-obscured, but all of it seemed to lead me to the same place: the center of the earth. It seemed to open up into the empty expanses beyond, all the places that were never there because there was something never enough to keep it contained.

I had never heard of the Dead Sea Scrolls before, but I had done some work with archeology before, and knew that the area around it was very interesting. It had been a part of the Jordanian-Palestinian territory until a few years before, but

Ah, right, sorry. I was going to press the button anyway, but… ah, it looks like that’s a talk we should be doing!

ARCHIVIST
It’s fine.

[REVERSE OF THE PAD REFERS.]
[MARTIN CLEARS HIS THROAT.]
MARTIN
Alright. Alright. Let’s… talk about what’s going on. What’s at stake?

ARCHIVIST
I - we’ve been over this. I can see why the Sister won’t want to talk to us.

MARTIN
And she shouldn’t.

ARCHIVIST
Sergeant Ardeth Singh. He ran a small-time prostitution ring out of his home. He killed someone and stole some of the bodies. I caught the guy because of it, but…

MARTIN
You didn’t tell any of us. Why?

ARCHIVIST
Prison is not good for it.

[MARTIN TAKES A DEEP BREATH.]
MARTIN
So… what? You said, “End of statement”?

ARCHIVIST
It’s been edited.

MARTIN
Oh. Okay. So I guess this is it, then? ‘Fine. Sometimes I just want to hang out with my friends. Wherever that might be.

ARCHIVIST
Where are we going?

MARTIN
I don’t know. We’re going to the library.

ARCHIVIST
Oh. Oh, god! There’s just… we’re not… I don’t know, totally blank.

What are you doing?

MARTIN
I’m… I’m trying to ‘anchor’ the table’. I read the statement, so I know the position I’ve got to be in, what to say, say no. But sometimes I think, what if I just…?

ARCHIVIST
It’s not a question of if, it’s a question of when.

MARTIN
But it’s over. It’s over with. Whatever it was, it’s over with.

ARCHIVIST
I mean, I guess, but what do you want from it?

[MARTIN TAKES A SHAKY BREATH.]
MARTIN
I want to help.

ARCHIVIST
[Angry] I don’t CARE about your friendship, Martin! That was a choice! You chose to help! Now don’t you worry about your friends, okay? I know, I know you wouldn’t be here if you - if you - but there is a part of me that is so very tired of being trapped in your flat by your stupid phone.

MARTIN
So help me, and it’s all fine!

ARCHIVIST
Fine.

MARTIN
I’ll just leave.

Okay. Okay.

Did the police still care about it?

They did.

MARTIN
Wait, you said the police did not care?

STATEMENT GIVER
[Sigh] That’s not important.

MARTIN
Yeah, okay, so, you heard that loud argument from the police about Jimmy…

STATEMENT GIVER
[Laughingly] You know what, I suppose it is.

MARTIN
Yeah, well, apparently it…

STATEMENT GIVER
Oh, well, it’s fine, I guess. I mean, it was a bit… weird, but nothing really to be concerned about.

MARTIN
What?

STATEMENT GIVER
Well, I thought I’d let you know of some of the more… sinister items that we’d recovered from Gertrude’s stash.

MARTIN
What?

STATEMENT GIVER
Oh, just for my own notes, just FYI.

MARTIN
And you don’t think they’ll help you stop the Unknowing?

STATEMENT GIVER
Not directly. But I think… [Sigh] I think I can help.

, and you don’t leave anything out.

It was, uh - a bit, an odd time. I don’t know. We were, uh, on our way to the Antarctic, to the South Pole Station, when, out of the blue, this young lady came up to me.

She was little but the center of attention, and there were some weird things about the way she moved. She must have been about twenty, but I knew she’d been p-watching a movie, because we never spoke. And when I asked her what she wanted, she just looked at me, eyes hazy from the drug, and I - I didn’t want to say anything.

Then, one day, she turned to me and, without warning, she started talking. She started talking about how great the boat would be if we could just wait, and, and keep waiting. I said no, of course, but she just looked at me and said, “I’m not watching anymore.”

There was silence for a long time, and then, without warning, a very loud noise went out, and my wife started to cover her ears.

I wanted to tell her that it was a movie, that it wasn’t being displayed, that it wasn’t a live performance. But I couldn’t do it. Too much of a blur.

Then, without warning, a man entered the auditorium. He was big, and look, don’t get me wrong, he was handsome, but his mouth was cold. It was a trick he used to fool Audie.

He said he was a horror director, that there were going to be some really good films, and that he’d put his name forward for the Academy. He wouldn’t be directing them, he’d be writing them, but that wouldn’t stop him being recognised. He’d be in the script, and if he turned up to see a film, he’d be recognisably John Gourley.

He stared at me for a long time, eyes so big they made me feel as though I might be watching him read out of some dull classroom joke, and he actually started shaking his head. By then, I was really peeved, and started to walk out. I told him I was just showing him what I thought was a really bad idea. I mean, I’d never actually seen a horror movie, and I was just giving him an idea. I hope he got it.

He put his hand in mine, like really, really small, and gripped it like an icepick. I could feel panic starting to rise in his voice, and I tried to tell him there was no way I was putting him in danger, that I’d never want to.

I had my own ideas, but I didn’t want to talk him out of it, so I just started walking back toward the doors. I didn’t look back at the doors, either. Just one more set of eyes, that… [sniffs] I suppose you could call it, and I’d gone my separate way, but I kept walking. When I saw a metal staircase on one of the floors, I decided I could at least take a moment to get my feet properly massaged before climbing down the next one.

I couldn’t have said it was a good idea, but Mass Effect was such a demanding job. After three months I’d become so close to breaking point that I actually lost the respect of most of my team. Some of them, at least, who worked for the writing of the game, would have forgiven me for not showing them more. When the three-month mark rolled around, I decided to break off even more time for walks with a different part of the building. This way, I didn’t get worked up over the unending stream of spiders.

It was the middle of the day, and the building was in a bit of a mess. Some of the older residents had turned up to do some DIY work on the lower floors, and I’d seen a handful of construction sites that needed a good shakeup, so they were in a good mood.

I headed over to one of the smaller bedrooms, lying just in front of a dusty stepladder that overlooked the corridor leading up to the auditorium. The air was cold, so thin you felt like you were fighting against the rain against your own door. I found it, and I lay down to enjoy the show.

I was very intentional about not bringing any of the equipment with me. I had some MP3 players lying on top of a stack of papers, so when I found the keys I spent a minute or two perying on the floor, and began

ELIE
You’re quite like her, you know.

ELIAS
I mean… not exactly.

BERLIN
Yes. You are not imagining it.

ELIAS
It is a strange and deeply fearful thing to be human. To be moved and possessed by a useless and - degraded animus.

I suppose it never hurts anyone to have their work copied, really.

ELIAS
Ah, but no. I suppose it never hurts anyone to be read.

BARFOR
How is she here, by the way?

ELIAS
She…. She seems to be recovering. Well to be honest. I don’t know exactly what she was doing, or if she’s even still in there. The last thing I saw of her was a new layer of skin.

BARFOR
That is almost three weeks ago, isn’t it?

ELIAS
Yes. I wasn’t able to get a copy of the ECDC financial report just then, but on the balance sheet for the ‘End of the Journey’ film, it was listed as being owned by someone claiming to be Morpheus. It was liquidated and transferred to a trust fund.

[BARFOR SIGHS.]
BARFOR
It’s not… Not really.

ELIAS
It has a history of going wrong.

BARFOR
But it doesn’t… hurt me.

ELIAS
Not really. The longer I’ve been working for them, I’ve noticed more and more similarities between the way people have reacted to terminal or life-threatening situations and this… ‘End of the Journey’.

BARFOR
What happened?

ELIAS
It felt like… There wasn’t enough detail in the report, but at the time, I thought it was a septic pregnancy gone wrong.

BARFOR
Sounds dubious.

ELIAS
Yes. It was a bit of a strange one, isn’t it? The details difficult to put together, but roughly half of the staff had returned from their holidays with abdominal pains, and the other half had returned with something they had mistakenly diagnosed as a brain tumour. None of them had any sort of exit nor did they seem to be in any way connected.

When I joined up, it seemed like they were planning to continue the ritual. I suggested they try to communicate with the outside world.

BARFOR
So they went to Australia for months?

ELIAS
That’s what they asked when they interrupted our ritual. They weren’t directly responding to our words, they were… symbolic. They took the form of trees, and the form of crowds, and the bouquet of coloured lights meant that any illusions we might have drawn could be easily dismissed.

BARFOR
And you came to deliver them?

ELIAS
We’ve always a right to. And more than anything, we’ve got to believe that the dead should be left alone. They’re a threatening power, and we should be wary of elevating them above ground.

BARFOR
Right. And what do you do if they attempt to perform a resurrection?

ELIAS
I don’t know. They’re… unpredictable. Though I suppose they have a certain charm, the more ‘elit’ you get.

BARFOR
So why not ally yourselves with the authorities and expose them for what they are?

ELIAS
I don’t know. The police certainly understand the threats they are now being asked to investigate, but I think they’re more interested in who’s been murdered and why.

BARFOR
How serious is it?

ELIAS
I don’t know. The authorities are becoming lax in not just protecting those in power, but in actually enforcing it. I don’t think they’ll wait for long to get here.

BARFOR
The Metropolitan Police?

ELIAS
They’ve lost the war on drugs. I suppose it’s a real shame, but it’s what the Metropolitan Police can do.

BARFOR
And you’re not going to help them with the torturers.

ELIAS
No, I…

BARFOR
Torturers. Or something.

ELIAS
If you really wanted to, you could certainly send someone else. But I can’t. This place has its own life and it’s very vulnerable.

BARFOR
And you can’t see that.

ELIAS
Not yet, though. I’

Statement, regarding a cleaning job on Hill Top Road, Oxford. Original statement given 3rd April, 2013. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.

Statement begins.

ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)
I don’t know this place. It’s not my fault. Just that I grew up in Hill Top Road, so I remember how that felt when we first moved up to that place. It was sour, and dreary, and somewhere between prison and factory I didn’t even know. But by the time I reached adulthood I had already seen the house a few times. It was older than most of the others I’d encountered, with pieces of it starting to fall off the walls and ceiling as recently as a few years ago. It reminded me of my childhood home, except that it was a single family house, and the walls were papered over in a rain of paint. The wallpaper had been painted a dark green that I didn’t recognise, but was now covered in a greasy brown that I reckon was the same colour as paint. The floor was covered in bookshelves, and stacked so high that they seemed to sway ever so slightly. I found my feet almost at the top, when I noticed the knob at the top of the stairs wasn’t working. The knob itself didn’t make any sound like it was made of any solid metal, but it was covered in tiny ice crystals, so large that the sight of them moving made my eyes hurt. Looking down the stairwell, I could see them swimming up and down, heavy and cold, each shining and milky white. The dark green didn’t seem to glow, but Iarno did. I couldn’t get over the heads that I was standing on, and looked around to see if there was anyone else who could hear it. There was no response from any of the doors, but Iarno didn’t stop until all that was left was a small patch of dark green, then the faded outline of a solitary figure.

I fled, ducking behind a door I thought might have been a trapdoor, and ducked into another room that might have contained… I don’t know, it didn’t matter. I ducked out of sheer panic. My hands exploded in cold sweat and my vision began to swim as I flailed about on the tiny mattress. I don’t know if it was the smell of the water, the long summer day, or something in my throat caused me to hyperventilate in some odd way. And I was fine. I’m fine now, though I do find it hard to concentrate on the task at hand.

I tried to ignore it, taking solace in the knowledge that, when it finally abated, I would no longer be needed. At least, I assumed that would be necessary.

That was when I woke up.

I didn’t have a clock in my room, just a cello. Someone had carved something into it earlier that morning, and taken it away when I asked, but the old man from earlier still bothered me. He kept asking me where I’d been, where I’d been resting, and I’d just written it off. He said it was the strangest dream I’d ever had. I asked him to tell me about the church, and he looked at me like I was stupid. “Spiritual leader”, he said, “one of the 10 lost boys”. I said okay, and he started to laugh it off, told me how great it was that my dreams didn’t discriminate. Then he

 faint dead hand, but no-one else seemed to notice. I suppose they didn’t talk too much, as no-one seemed to suspect there might be any outside interference. I wondered about the door a bit, and whether it was, as she put it, “like a different person”. And I set up my equipment, and patiently waited.

And then came the moment when all my doubts came true. I woke up this morning and to my surprise, the front door was open, ready for me to enter. I wasn’t allowed inside, but I couldn’t help but notice the spot light was still on, and the window was still slightly cloudy, as though it had never been lit in the morning. And as I reached for the small knob, I noticed that it was ever so slightly uneven. There was a shine to it, like it had been polished and polished over an extremely dark material. I reached up to try and lift it, but instead I got a tight squeeze, and the door slammed heavily into the door. I had no choice but to sit there for a while, as I was suddenly very aware of how my flesh felt around the edges of my skin. It didn’t help me move.

I don’t think it’s going to surprise anyone when my body finally gave up. But I suppose it will do no good. It wasn’t entirely my fault, wasn’t it? I didn’t realize how badly my body had been worked, the fatigue and painkillers kicking in so suddenly, and all the specialist needles and painkillers that I had taken with me, leaving me completely drained.

I called in sick to my shift, and just tried to ignore it. My simple, feigned numbness didn’t really pan out, you know. After a few days, I was all but back to full force, and I told everyone I was going to press the panic button. I mean, it was what, three weeks of panic? No, no, it was more like… I was taking stock of my injuries, and I noticed something.

I’d been sitting on the floor for over a week, and I had finally broken out of the left front tooth. This shouldn’t have been a problem, given the state of my teeth, but I was worried about how I was going to get out of the door, so I was careful to take a few precautions. I took out my trusty knife, and walked towards the dentistry school.

Of course, there’s a huge and wonderful plastic surgery centre right next to my office, and it turned out to be perfectly adequate. I knew exactly where to throw in the money order, and simply handed Alan my completed application, which he did surprisingly well in hisazer. I told him I’d pay for the dental work, and not a cent more, though obviously I didn’t mention why.

I told him I’d pay $10,000.00 cash. No bonuses or payments. It was almost three months before I got paid, and it was still getting ominously warm in the office. There was no way I was going to be able to withstand the chill in that place, but I was absolutely sure that if I stood up and told the truth, then I’d be there in time.

So, I stood there in silence, waiting for my moment, and I saw a round table in one of the corridors. It was entirely empty, but there were four chairs, two supplies and a scalpel amongst the mess. I sat at the very front, and Michael came round, carrying a small pile of files. He was very careful, and seemed almost embarrassed to be moving about the place so openly, so I was very pleased his efforts were paying off.

I started to push old questions at Michael, but he just looked at me with an expression on his face that looked more like frustration than surprise. He told me that he was the youngest person to work at the Cosmetic Dental Institute, and that he was chosen for that position because of his skillset. And then he started to explain the cuts.

He explained to me the pieces of equipment that he had on hand, some scissors, a laser cutter, a rotary toolbox, a graduated can opener, a hypodermic syringe, and a quartet of rubber gloves. He said that he’d been cut three times by things that called themselves the Institute, and that his third time around it was nothing short of a miracle.

And as he spoke, I was starting to feel that itch in the back of my mind, like a vicious buzzing, like a malfunction in his mind. And I’d been careful on my visits to make sure that I wasn’t disturbed, but on the edge of what felt like war

 plastic of the same name. My memory of the subsequent classes have been a bit patchy, but I recall having basically no luck in my studies. I did have a supportive family, but it was a long way from supportive. The kids rebelled against the strictures of their sex education, and I was presumably left to my own devices.
It was a life of crime, and it felt more like a life of hell than any simple prison sentence. Sure, there were occasional glares in my direction, but they were lighted by the intense sunlight I found myself attracting. And it didn’t help that I was probably the only person in the class, with barely a whisper of authority.
It was a strange time, even for me. I was probably the first virgin to go to that school, back in the early 60s, and certainly the first in my line of work, but it slowly crept across my hearing that other students were also going through the program.
There were of course more opportunities for criminal activity at Osgoode, and the pupils there were far from affluent, with almost all the adult residents either working or looking to find work. Anyone who talked loud enough to attract predators ended up getting their say in the mostly rancorous atmosphere. None of the adult residents spoke up for either sex, and the sex offenders were almost uniformly from the sex offender register.
I did see occasionallyfolk who spoke Polish, Italian or Romanian who said they were looking for members with darker personalities, but their criminal histories and appearance would have sent them to the station on crack, not to speak of the horrors of the situation they had found themselves living through. It wasn’t uncommon for me to find myself the only person openly mixed up on the street. I preferred to think of it as a family thing, but those I turned down often said it was because they felt like they couldn’t talk to me, or were too ashamed to say. I never had any time for that, and was glad when Lewisham happened, so I could get out of that place for a while.
I was keen to go to Basildon as soon as possible, as I had heard from a mutual friend who had been there with me, Tommy. He said he was looking to catch a break and come over with a friend of his father’s. I thought it would only make things more confusing if they never arrived, so I didn’t push it.
It was about a month ago, just as we were starting to look into the night raid that had landed us all so deeply involved in Heathcote. I suppose you’d have to have heard about it.
We were riding on a swell near Sloane when it happened. When it hits, it hurts. Sloe said it was as if every nerve ending in your body are ‘on fire’. We were close enough to smell it, but far enough from it to be safe. I kept riding along, but where we actually hit was a series of holes in the road. There was a way over the holes to get in, but nobody’s on it. It was like a series of dirty roads, with one or two cars in each one, but they were all empty.
When we got there, Tommy said there had been some problem with the road, and that they were gonna call us for water. We wanted to go inside, but we’d just about seen it as a trap. As he told it, it felt quite enough to get out of the car. I climbed in, and whilst I was stepping lightly on sharp, icy roads, I brought out my own axe.
We spent a few minutes in the car before we had to shut the car. I had the back window shut while I got the door over the threshold. I told him I’d just been going for a drink, as I normally do, when there was a sound from inside. I think it was his. From the other side. I heard something, but it wasn’t the crashing of the car or the fact that it was nearly pitch black.
It was just that the engine was still running, and I couldn’t see a thing. Not until it hit the outside of a house a few yards away. In the darkness I could barely make out the shape of a face. At that point I decided to call the police, and got out my phone. I wasn’t about to freak out at the needless hassle of calling someone in without first.
The face that finally came out was that of Toby Carlisle. He was the second officer that had helped save my life, but he had been the hardest to track down. He had come up behind me as I was climbing out of the car, and as I turned to watch, there in front of me was a clear patch of road he had clearly marked in red. He had written legend there, and I assumed that I could

 and I heard him say something about how nice it was to work for Robert Montauk. Then he hung up.

There was no sign of Sam, though. As far as I could tell, she had vanished.

I wasn’t sure what to do. Do I call the police? Even if I did, I wouldn’t know where to get a cellphone from, and how would I get it to work with this phone? I also hadn’t really paid much attention to the time, and my phone said it was international, but I were really hoping to use it to call someone to pick up my statement. I had an emergency of that sort, and in the end I had to basically beg for the life of Davina Milano.

I hope you understand by now, but if you’ve been around long enough, I’m sure you know what I mean. We’d had a child with cancer about a year or so before, and he’s been okay. But she’d left for work, and couldn’t be sure where she was going. This whole thing had really just been a blow to her confidence, and she just couldn’t trust anyone.

I know that sounds horrid. I really did believe her. I mean, I’m not some weird monster or anything, but I’d always felt a bit off. There was something wrong with how I felt. My whole self was telling me that I was fine, that I was somehow fine. But I know better now, I think. I don’t think I was fine for the longest time.

Daisy was the first. I knew she was something special. I used to love her. I still do, I don’t look back on it, I think. She was different too. I sometimes think of her as something of a twin. But I know she wasn’t that special, not at all.

Growing up, I was always weird, but by the time I met her I had pretty much decided to let it go and move on. I don’t know if it was because I was weirdly attracted to her, or because we were both weird, but I got to talking to her like a normal teenager. We’d been to see each other a couple of times, and knew each other outside of school. I think it was about four months before I saw her properly. I was hanging out with my friends, or maybe just because she’d brought a friend along, I got to talking to her like I was talking to a friend.

We’d mostly just been hanging out, but once we’d gotten back from lunch, and it was time for her to actually meet her, I introduced myself, said my goodbyes, and grabbed a seat at the bar. I leaned back in my chair, and looked at my beer, waiting for it to change. It hadn’t, but the taste of salt that leak from my fingers was something different, something that made me think of distant, distant mountains. I wanted to get over that. I wanted to talk to her. But I couldn’t. As far as I could tell, Davina Horgan was staring at me, so -

 were very aware of the situation and had immediately summoned the support of several officers.

One of the officers who arrived was Harry Reichert, a member of the public who had been walking with me on the street, and gave me a big thumbs up. Harry gave me a thumbs up, as I was about to ask him to fetch me some lunch. I didn’t hear from him again until almost an hour later, and when I did he said he’d been walking for hours, and there didn’t seem to be any sign of me. I don’t think I really knew what to do, so I just went back to living in bed. I don’t remember exactly how I felt. Something was definitely wrong, but I don’t remember it being unpleasant or strange. I did, though, and that afternoon I was having a dream about walking the streets of my favourite Amsterdam neighbourhood. I was going to walk, but I didn’t know which way would be east, and there weren’t any lights on, making it impossible to tell. I was still in that city some weeks later, in late June, when I had a chance encounter an apparition.

It was easy to ignore it. I wasn’t completely black, and it didn’t bother me at all. I didn’t let myself feel anything was being pulled apart or packed up, like I’d been sold a ticket to a faraway place. I was lying in my living room, trying to sleep, when I heard it. The faintest sound I could make out was the creak of my bed. The walls creaked, like someone’s been knocking, but I didn’t let myself think about it enough to make a sound that would let me know. I went to investigate, but the room was empty, and the sound came again, so abruptly, that I fell to the floor in surprise.

As I went to take a breath and start to warm up, I heard a sound from the bed, but this time the sound wasn’t like it had before. In its place I heard a gentle scratching, something resembling a creaking mattress. The scratching stopped, abruptly, and for a moment I stood there in silence. I didn’t know what to do, and no idea exactly what to do should I ever find out that Alan was telling me about something he’d encountered on the streets of Genoa. He didn’t tell me what, though I did get an answer on the phone, and I talked to Tammy, who was equally perplexed and seemed genuinely surprised I’d heard from him before he disappeared.

I drove down to Genoa, coming back regularly to update you on my progress and what not. I don’t even know why I took this path, something about the old man’s tale intrigued me, along with the possibility of some sort of supernatural encounter or odd dream. But I decided I was just going to keep pursuing my own research, nothing of consequence to be doing so. I don’t think I was going to be able to go any further with it, and at the time it just seemed like a great relief.

That was the week I got the invitation to the Miskatonic Music Festival, a week before the Ivy Meadows Music Festival, and from what I could tell you I was going to be spending a lot of time there. The festival itself was lovely, something about it that I really enjoyed, but after a few hours in the afternoon, I was walking past the old Pier towards the old town centre, keeping an eye on it from a taxi. As I mentioned, I’m black, and I found it odd that in spite of it, I got a very strong feeling for the direction I was going in. I was taking a direct hit from the sky, but despite it being the middle of the day, the rain was powerful enough to muffle the sounds of the crowd.

As I walked, I felt an an an the air grow thick and heavy, a while before I realised that it was Vampireuary, the annual charity musical that raised money for the Magnus Institute. Eric Idle, the man who played Mr. Mickel, had finished his set, and the audience was now standing, waiting for the show. I walked over, and the lights came on, and dancing began, winding through the dark, heavy rain. It was choreographed, quite simply, and flowed easily through the four horses that led the way.

I stumbled, falling harder and harder, and hitting my head on the plasterboard, and the chorus began to surge forward, joined by the groaning sounds of the audience. I was alone. I don’t know how long I lay there, waiting for the show, but I must have been dancing for almost twenty minutes before I broke, and

 and then the wall was completely dark. I was about to sit up when my watch told me that the lights were coming back.
I hurried over to them, not wanting to ruin them, and turned them on. The images of the dead woman with the torn throat were back, clearer than ever. I stared at them, and they seemed even more awful than before. I tried to make out what was going on, where Mary was, but trying to focus seemed to make those pictures worse.
At this point, I almost threw up. Had someone taken the circuit breaker and tampered with it? The house seemed to be on fire, and I knew that even if Mary could be reached, someone was at work. I ran to the window and found it locked. I tried the doorbell, but there was no reception in the building, so I ignored it. What elses to be done?
I flew to Bolton, and didn’t even book a hotel room. I just waited. There was no-one home, and I was spending the last nights available to me, so I decided to go for a walk. The street was deserted, and at the far end I could see a street lamp behind the house, casting a stark, warning light on the thickening black dust. I headed for that street lamp, and noticed for the first time the stark white tablecloth draped from the back. Brayntis had torn the tablecloth and stuffed it around the wound. It was a strange thing to notice at the time, but I’d seen a few victims of this, and knew that the chance of it being the same person was vanishingly small. The dust had been accumulating for hours before this, and it was now covering the whole of the room. I looked at the fly, and saw it twitching and dangling, suspended by carbon strings from what was clearly a dozen glue sticks.
At this, I ran to the window, and yelped as hard as I could. It released a cloud of dust and kicked out at me, but just at the moment I needed to leap back and hit it. The table fell with a grunt, and I started to panic. I was only a skeleton, and didn’t have a scratch. The next thing I remember is the police, and a lot of explaining to do to prove that it was me. I think my father said there must have been some sort of cover-up, but I have no idea if he was behind it.
They came in shortly after midnight, and I saw my tormentors clustered around the table. They called me ‘crimewave’, and I think in the back of my mind I was thinking that I would prefer they died of a bullet, rather than a hatchet.
Eventually, they tired themselves, and a response was given. The criminals looked at me in apartments, and one of them gave me a look over. His was a serious looker, and once he showed me a handgun, I wasn’t at all alarmed. More importantly, I was hungry.
That was when I heard the scream. It came from the bedroom, and it wasn’t from Mary. It was this dreadful, whistling sound, and after a few seconds I realised what had happened. I ran to her side, and found her lying in a kneeling heap on the floor. Her body was black, with scratches that left us both quite shaken. I took her to be the prostitute named Mary Keay, and told her to spread her legs for some light, as there was no smell yet.
I wrapped her in a bedpan, and lowered myself so that she was beneath the covers. She attempted to rise, but I gripped her hand and pulled her down. She screamed, and I heard her fall to the floor. I ran, and they never came back to harm me.
I got to work immediately. I was going to book an account, but Mary’s condition had taken her off her bed, and I was discovering that none of the work I’d been doing was leaving her any time soon. Part of me wanted to tell her that, and tell her how much it had helped. But a part of me knew that she’d just killed herself, and I wanted no part of whatever was happening.
So, I took to her bedroom, and pulled the covers up over her face. The result was a messy death. One that didn’t quite feel right, but I couldn’t bring myself to leave without getting an explanation. From what I could see, she was lying in that bed, but when I got home, she was gone. There was no sign of any intruder, or of foul play, so I simply assumed that whatever was going on, her killer had snuck in somehow. And as I stared at that scene, I began to hear something from the kitchen. It was a faint call, but I got over it

 silent, but I knew that silence was not something I was capable of.

I should have known. Some of this was obvious: why, for all my power, I was still unable to read the old catechism, when there was such a space in front of it, and such an engraving on its surface. But other things were subtle, and I began to notice them. The first thing to turn the page was the date. The ink had run very, very clean, and there was no mistaking the date of the chartering of the ship, as the star of the voyage was visible in the waning hours of the daylight that preceded it.

The second thing was the presence of the captain. He sat at the head of the ship, and his attention solely was focused on the instrument panel, where a young man named Jack stared out sadly at the floating sky. When the captain looked up, he had no idea who Jack was, but he knew that he was dead. The sky was empty, as the wind died, and the only sound was the gentle rolling of the Thames.

The third thing that concerned me was the language. The captain spoke perfect English, and I could not help but notice that the language that he spoke was French. The captain looked to me, and I couldn’t help but reflect that I was not speaking his language.

He told me that I was to travel the ocean between Costa Rica and the Bahamas, and that he had rich and powerful clients who would need nothing from the government except the crew. He stared at me, and I left.

I traveled back to England much more quickly, and Gatwick was gone. By the time I arrived at JFK Airport, I had my passport and the relevant diplomatic immunity. I thought that was strange, but it seemed the country to which I returned should be an unsurprising departure.

So I thought nothing of it, and stepped into the waiting room.

I was greeted by an old man who introduced himself as John Amherst. He looked like his late 60s, and dressed like his retirement home had been the last century. An old man with a shock of gray hair and a face that had never been cracked. He spoke perfect English, and Gatestone handed me a pale faced passport as I approached. I noticed with a start the waxworks, once again erected over the doorway, and spoke little of what I might find there.

Then John Amherst started talking. He told me that he was well acquainted with Mr. Wilkinson, and had used it to get into many of his accounts. She had put it in her will that her assets would not be transferable, and those who might be entitled to them would have to 'make an appointment with their guardian or, in the unlikely event of their death, their guardian and trustee, to whom they’d have to make an appointment, and then there was the matter of obtaining a copy of the will and testament of the man who had left it.

John Amherst told me that his client had left this will in 1986, after which point the deed had become null and void, and his client’s name had been stolen. He never specified what his client had looked for in an heir, and I found out later that the will had specifically named Cordwainer Bush, and as for myself, I never found out.

I was never able to discover the will’s words to read it, and I was very lucky, being only two minutes before the window of my modest bungalow gave out and the windows collapsed, trapping me inside.

It was near the end of April when I heard it. There was a sudden knock on the door. It wasn’t hard, or impatient, just a light series of taps. As it rained, I would look out and see the door, once again open, and a man who stepped out. He was dressed in a crisp white shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and blue tie. He asked if I was ready to go.

No, I wasn’t ready to go. He asked how much the cemetery had been sold. I didn’t know. He paused, and mumbled something about directions. When I asked him what I had to do, he just shook his head and said, “Come on, I’ve been waiting for someone to drown these things,” before he took off at a random angle. I could follow him a while longer, but he was soon gone.

I was left standing there, alone with a feeling that something horrid had happened to me, and I wanted desperately to tell someone, urgently. I did, though, and later that night I started to worry that the cemetery wasn’t just a place where dead bodies were desiccated and turned to charcoal, or that it had been turned into a house. I thought about phoning
