 coming to pick up the trunk, the foot of which seemed to be missing. I had spent the day looking into the strange notes that had fallen out of Mr. Gwynne’s coat pocket, but I had no luck finding him, or anyone else who might have been responsible for them.
As far as I know, Mr. Gwynne is still off the register of any educational institution, but there’s one small piece of evidence that might give some preliminary insight into his background. In 2009, Mr. Gwynne was found to have made several deliveries to a company called Express Delivery. The packages were addressed to various educational institutions in and around the Kingston area, and one of the envelopes was quite large, apparently handwritten. It read “Educational Institutions”.
Express Delivery is something of a strange one, built company which Mr. Gwynne reportedly purchased from an elderly stockbroker in 1991. The firm was dissolved shortly after it was put up for sale, and none of the documents appear to list its exact location on file with the Companies Commission, but it seems to have used these same addresses in the same period for three different companies. Until now, I had assumed that the homes it listed as having been bought by the Gwynnes, the actual owners of the business, were the ones that Mrs. Gwynne claimed for Mr. Gwynne. That didn’t make much sense, if it was true.
There is also the matter of the trains. Mr. Gwynne said that he had no such company, but when we were both heading to catch up, we passed through Piccadilly Station and I noticed a black Range Rover travelling at high speed down the road. We quickly checked and it was a Lancra, which is technically a police car, but what really sticks out to me is the inscription on the side - “with great love from gregory”. I wondered about it a bit - is it a treatise or just a man bragging? I never even heard him brag before. Anyway, as we drove past the Houses of Parliament we noticed a small group of people clustered around the platform, watching us intently. The majority of the people in the train were standing at the same time as us; they were mostly standing there waiting for something to happen. Looking around, I could see the large majority of those in this section of the station were at least a few years my senior. One of them, this “George Gilbert Scott”, was looking at me with an expression that looked almost playful. A strange expression, I’d say, but I’d been too distraught to care. We hoped he’d returned to the station as quickly as possible; I’d had to make the only onward run of the night before.
As we pulled away from the Houses of Parliament, I tried to hear out the others. There was no response I could make from the others, nor did they seem to be paying any attention to my absence. So I returned to the platform and waited. I was going to make some announcements to the other passengers, perhaps get them to come and watch me - but as I stepped to the front of the train, I saw the faces of every passenger I had ever known try to stare at me, and some of them gave me half-hearted smiles or stared with suspicion.
Almost as soon as I stepped off the train, I was met by another figure. They stared as well, the confusion and suspicion clearly caused them. They stood at least five feet apart, and they stared at me with something resembling confusion. I walked up to them, "Excuse me, are you having any trouble deciding where to look?"
They looked at each other for a few seconds, as though they were discussing the most unlikely hypothesis and then, without warning, they launched into a full attack, ripping the faces off each other with savage force and throwing them to the floor. There was none of that fear that I seen in the faces of the others, or indeed at any of the others. There was just complete disregard.
As I stared at these strangers who had just ripped their faces off, trying to decide whether to try and fight or flee, I began to smell the blood. It was like a wave of infected dirt. All over my head, the feel of the metal detectors, and the sense of the steel, that was all that kept me safe was increased by the presence of blood.
And then I saw it. An isolated figure stood there, though speed was impossible to determine from the angle of the shot from the gun. A thin white beam shot through the air and hit him hard. His blade went dark, and he began to panic. His pistol went dark as well, and in a single movement, he vanished.
I tried to reload, to stalemate them, but without fail they would move to attack me. I was helpless to do anything to stop

 try and make contact after it’s gone wrong.

ARCHIVIST
But what happened?

SASHA
Oh, just the one.

ARCHIVIST
One in the car?

SASHA
Yeah.

Arden was gone. Thought he’d gone for a while, I thought. Had we got a chance to explore more? We were heading towards the South Pacific at the time, so that must have been the plan. But he hadn’t returned to the Currituck.

You have to understand, I almost lost it with Arden. Thought he’d gone off the deep end, driven mad or something. But every time I thought he’d gone the other way, he’d come back.

It was one of the other –

ARCHIVIST
No, I understand, I’m talking about the Currituck Islands. Those are our territories. They have their own laws and customs. They can get a bit… complicated. You were out of your depth, but you were still only halfway there. You’ve still got a long way to go.

But you seem to have made it a point to always return, no matter what the cost. No waiting around for a call to remind you of the long, dead sea. No searching through dusty maps or rusted ancient treasures.

For the most part, I do forget that I even exist. I just… feel a… an a churning anger rising inside of me. For those who don’t, I mean. I’m only really aware of one thing. Which is when to pull the trigger.

Most of the officers on the beat are too busy trying not to look at me. Dashcam views a small sliver of humanity salvaged from the wreckage, but hush–
ARCHIVIST

Stop.
SASHA

Off we go.
ARCHIVIST

Melanie, is this her?
SASHA

No. I don’t know.
ARCHIVIST

Well, it’s her, I think. She came to me.
SASHA

No, it’s him. I think… I think he’s with the Institute.
ARCHIVIST

But he, um, he works here?
SASHA

Maybe. Jon thinks the same way, you know. He’s working on a case right now. I, I know where he is.
ARCHIVIST

And I see his office on the other side, open at the end of this corridor.
SASHA

He didn’t come here.
ARCHIVIST

No. I suppose not.
SASHA

I just…
ARCHIVIST

That office used to be here.
SASHA

Maybe. I don’t know. I think I saw him out in the rain a few times.
SASHA

I know where he works.
ARCHIVIST

Yes, that is indeed – yes. I see… a long, thin corridor stretching down into the tunnels. Could be someone is in here.
SASHA

Come on.
ARCHIVIST

Come on, I’m not going down there.
SASHA

…

So you’re with me?
ARCHIVIST

Yes, of course.
SASHA

Not here.
ARCHIVIST

Did Martin say he was going to make a statement?
SASHA

Oh, yes. He said it seemed right. I thought it would… be a good idea, you two go on ahead.

I mean, you still don’t know what a pet is, or when a human baby is going to be. But I’m telling you to go down there, to the Buried, and see for yourself.

Whatever your guts want to see.

 so me and Tim and the rest of the team had it so much worse. When she got sick, when she was taken over by the Faceless Ones, that was when we really started to suffer. Not like the usual… You know what, when she went the full Sobek, we suffered. Hard.
And you know what? I’m not sure I ever saw Tim Tregenza again. When she disappeared, or rather, the tunnels collapsed around her, and we all lost whatever connection we might have had to the surface. But we got a call that the tunnels had been discovered, and it was off limits. Now, the ones that lead out of the main Institute now, well, we can’t just leave them alone.
ARCHIVIST

Yes. I remember.
TIM

It was the most terrifying thing I had ever heard. I was trying to head back, but I got lost. Or rather, I think I went too far, and I tripped. I fell 20 feet down a short corridor, and broke my arm. I wanted to say something, to yell, but there was silence. I looked around, but there was just me. Waiting. I - I don’t know if you’ve ever been stabbed, but it hurts. And I can’t have my arm. So I just… I just fell forward more. And it was over.
ARCHIVIST

I think that speaks volumes about your general state of mind.
TIM

Yeah. Well, you, you and me together, I guess. So, we try to stay well away from the Eye. And I suppose that’s been working fine so far.

Have you seen Sasha?
ARCHIVIST

We’ve been apart, but I’ve seen her plenty. Something about the way she moves?
TIM

Yeah. She gets weird vibes from time to time, I guess.
ARCHIVIST

Well that’s good. You going to tell us what happened, or let us investigate?
TIM

Yeah. I’m sure we could all use a bit of a break. Before, I was a bit of a claustrophobe, but after a bit of a holiday, I think I should be well adjusted.

So, I’m sure you’ll have a good analysis of what happened, but I thought… well, you know, when I started working with Sasha again, I thought she would be more comfortable with a bit of a break. She’s been adjusting to working from home on her dad’s side of the family, you see, while I’ve been adjusting to working from the office.

Sasha obviously isn’t a fan of not being able to see half the way around the building. Sometimes she overreacts and it is, sometimes she underestimates how hard it can be to not be spotted. Well, it’s been a hard few months.

I did do a bunch of work in my dad’s basement, you know? Just, just to push past the point. Well, that’s not quite true. It was mainly exploring, you see, he had apparently done work on something with electromagnetic waves, and I was just following along to see what it would be. So, you know, when I turned on the light, I was just as surprised as anyone that it didn’t work.

Sasha hadn’t done any research on this before, you know. She had just turned up with some spooky chalk marks and a notebook.

Well, I was right. It didn’t. I tried to replicate it a few times, she did some of the writing, but those replications just looked wrong. The chiselled lines were too neat, too clean. I mean, I’m not mad that it didn’t work, it’s not that bad. But something about those lines, like, separated by a gap of, I don’t know, maybe a foot or two, it, it made me feel very uncomfortable.

I kept going, just keep going, and I think eventually I - I got so excited that I started to, you know, scratch off a few blocks with my fingernails. I tried to nail them in place, but they were way too sharp for me. I got so worked up over it that I almost detached the section of plaster that I, I almost tore off.

But it kinda just dissolved into mush when I, when I started to tear out the blocks, the ones that weren’t supposed to be there in the first place. I, when I finished, I just went over and started over again. And I did start to do that a couple more times.

 don’t know why they chose that moment instead of the one before. The sky was falling, and the rain was going in. I must have lost all my control, for only at that moment did I realize how close I came to touching the precipice. I fell, and it was only when I was about to hit the ground hard that I realized I could hear Morse.

From somewhere in the base, Dr. William Wincott was shouting something about an accident. I think the words came to me, “A freak accident,” or at least I think that’s what it was. He sounded so scared, I was about to intervene, but something about the feeling of being hit by a car, the noise, the fear… I stepped in.

There’s a car accident waiting for you down there. No signing, they just want to drive it themselves. No insurance, you understand. None of it is going to be covered, not at all, it’s just -
NOT!SASHA

Oh.
ARCHIVIST

They’re still going to drive it. They’re still going to drive it on Indian soil. It’s exactly the sort of thing wee talk about on the Forester.

Statement of The Curator of Terrestrial Miles, regarding a series of misfiled notes which appeared in the Buried. Original statement given July 2nd, 2000. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, The Curator.

Statement begins.
ARCHIVIST (STATEMENT)

You’ll forgive me if I’m vague about the methods. I, I’m sure I don’t speak your language.

They weren’t stolen from me. I didn’t bring my notes, I’m sure. Something in the handwriting. Unsure what. I think I tapped my assistants on the shoulder and handed in my notice.

Maybe it was all some elaborate plan, to get me into the Cave as many other cemeteries do. It would be easier, and maybe Locke was just trying to push me into the fold. I don’t know. But I prefer the search I am.

The corpse of the man I buried was one of the last I saw of Rex Tillerson, and as I looked through the gaps in masonry and glass, I saw rows and rows of boxes lined along the inside wall. The outer wall had been completely covered with a grey-white chalk board, which appeared to lead directly to the mouth of Rex Tillerson, as if it were still attached. I saw a hole in the wall a few inches below that board, which seemed to lead almost immediately to the empty space in the wall directly below.

That chalk didn’t match the colours of the corpse, and the wall behind it, almost seemed to be carved out of a solid block of stone. It must have been. Standing next to it was another corpse, both dressed and unattached. They were both dressed in black. The corpse before me was dressed in a crisp, white shirt with the sleeves rolled up, and a thin, black jacket. They both had the facial hair of a thin, flowing beard. They had the names carved in the black marble sarcophagus below them. They had no cause of death that I was aware of.

I know how it is these words float through my head. So many heads, so little time. What was my last thought, sending them to rest in the deep sleep they created? Perhaps I forged them myself, carving them with my own hands. Perhaps they were stolen from me years ago, from another soul, lost in a sea of meaningless thoughtlessness. Perhaps they were given to me by an old, cruel god, keen to use them for his own ends. Or perhaps I was tricked into thinking they were from another, equally foolish, attempt at seduction. Perhaps they were both.

No more than I need to tell you that the room is open, the dead don’t sleep.

I have been dreaming again, Jonah. The walls and ceiling are motionless, and the only sound is the sound of the bell

Right.

ELIAS (STATEMENT)
I knew it was something. Something big. I almost lost a friend to -

DAISY
(sighs)

- to loss of a kid. Too late for good, I guess. God, I feel - I feel - terrible. I wish I hadn’t. Life’s too short to be worrying about ends. (sigh) I feel like I’ve - I’ve fallen off the face of the planet.

I don’t know why I’m here. I don’t - really know what I’m here for, but - it’s Basira’s ‘cause, you know, me and Melanie’ve been - we’ve been together, so it’s kind of natural, right? (sigh) So we go to the Olympics, and... and then we’re together again, and - then we… sort of, well.

DAISY
It’s fine. You’re fine.

ELIAS (STATEMENT)
It’s fine. She’s pretty normal, you know? (sigh) She takes her time, and we sort of work together, you know? When you spend a month together - it’s nice. You know, when you’re into it. So, (sigh) I mean, it’s fine. She doesn’t really do things on her own, you know? We’re not like, you know, together or anything like that. She’s just, she’s quiet, and you sort of find yourself liking her company, right? (sigh) I mean, I’ve gotten...(sigh) I’ve had boyfriends before, and they’ve never really had the social grittiness that I’m used to. Is that weird? Does it make me an unsuitable match? (sigh)

Anyway, my sister Alexis works there, and we sort of go on 'dates' whenever we’re not getting anything – cooking, cleaning, that sort of thing. It’s fine, I guess, since we have our own homes, and those little moments where we get together and read, you know? It’s fine.

So, I asked her out on a Tuesday, and she said yes. No, she said the same thing as she’d done for the last few years. And - (sigh) - it’s hard to say no to her. Sometimes I worry she’s only going to say yes because she’s scared of me. And I’m not the nicest person, so… (sigh) She’s scared of me.

She’s been keeping me company through most of the night, been staring out for the most part, let me tell you that I’m very lucky that she’s never made a move on me. Even when she’d come here to deliver, and I’m the one that needs it most. She’s always come to the cleaners with this - mountain of junk - that she’s lugged round. I’m used to seeing boxes of used syringes and stuff like that.

God, I think I actually had a mild reaction to it. I actually wanted to push her away. Get her to move. But she’s gotten so quiet, and then we’d talk about it, and it was all just - gloom.

I tried to stick around, to say something, but there was just this - distance, to everything. You know, when you stick your neck out too far, you start to hear the whispering, the not-so-subtle suggestion that maybe you shouldn’t be here. To be honest, I was finding it hard to fully trust her, and I mean, I’m not just going to say that out loud, but we’d been over this for months. I had good memories of her, of course, and plenty of bad ones; the way the door had twisted in her hand made me think of old, empty houses, empty lots, that whispered to her.

I was careful in my head - I was careful,to be quite honest. It’s not that I didn’t want to trust the woman - she was very nice, in a way I’d never found in myself, my little parasite self, which is to be honest, quite delightful.

But it’s just that I’d never -

 Danny Wasilla said, I asked him how it was going, and he just shrugged and gestured us all away. I couldn’t hear the other burn victims screaming, though, so I couldn’t really make it clear enough.

At this point Isabella came over to our tent and started to dance. There was no one there to see it, and some of the others seemed to be asleep, so I couldn’t really tell what was going on. But she was lively, and asked questions in a lively way, so I listened.

She said her name was Isabella and that she was the mother of two young children. When she was first listed as missing, her baby ‘d-doll’ was gone, and when I asked her about it, she said her ‘first name’ was the same as her ‘last name’, which is something she kept in the exact same frame. When we were all waiting for the funeral, she just kept asking us what we wanted, and we just shook their heads and said they didn’t know.

Isabella Stevenson, however, didn’t want to leave. She said she’d been staying with this doctor for a month when she found out she was pregnant. The doctor said it had been a normal pregnancy and that there was no indication of foul play. The family living in the house had been very accepting of her, and it wasn’t long before the baby was out, though they hadn’t spoken.

I wasn’t quite as shocked as some of the others, who had heard this before, but it didn’t bode well for the health of the baby, especially as there had been a lot of discussion over the previous few days about whether to try and move it, or leave it with the family at the moment. This doctor had turned up to the funeral, and though we’d had our requests repeatedly, we still felt like we had enough evidence of harm to merit going to the funeral. We were going to leave it with the family, though.

As soon as we got near the cemetery, though, Isabella started throwing out the baby ‘s ‘buds’. Something’s a‑hiding baby ‘s ‘buds’. Fresh ones, fresh from the canal. A baby’s ‘mouth covered in blood. ‘Dead baby’, she said. Horrible, terrible words. I just wanted to stay away from that place.

I mean, I’m used to it, to see the rubbish that babies’ mouths are made of, the sick and twisted fetuses that bleed into the empty spaces of the casket. My mouth is not conditioned to take in sound and the sudden, deep moan of pain can send any thought I might have entertained fleeing for my sense of propriety.

Still, there was something about that, to see such a crumpled, shuddering face, as though every nerve ending were abruptly paralyzed, and the baby seemed to be crying with one of its hands. There was no – shame in it, no conscious plan or malicious intent. Just, simply, the terrible, terrible loss of a baby.

And then Isabella got to her feet and walked purposefully into the room. She placed her hands upon the table and calmly walked over to the heavy-looking model, who did not say a word as she placed the tiny body upon it and handed it a birthing basket. She reached into her coat and pulled out a tiny shovel. I followed suit, feeling oddly conflicted over whether to offer assistance or flee. Either way, my head was already swimming with premonitory fears, as Isabella had roughly pulled the placenta from my shoulder, and pumped it into the gaping maw.

The moment she had done so, there was no chance that the skull of this baby girl wouldn’t break, popping open like an eggshell, sending forth a cloud of pus dripping into the now milky trough. I watched in horror as her hand slowly, painstakingly peeled back the rough skin that stuck to the cranium. There was no chance it would still be alive for more than a few hours. I watched in horror as her fingers peeled off the rough skin of the skull, and the arm began to convulse violently.

She raised the jaw slowly, shuddering at what she was doing, and released my brother’s head slamming into the table. It barely lodged there, and she turned to run. I followed her out; she didn’t know what that meant. Perhaps I had abandoned her. All I knew was that my brother had been placed upon the table, and his dying wish had been to die.

In my brother’s case, the wish had been for a baby. An infantile one, which would

 hesitate, or perhaps just as a reminder that I wasn’t alone out there. I have no idea where else it might have gone.

I haven’t been on another train for some time, at least not since this experience made me realise how wrong my previous route was. I mean, if there’s other stuff up there - like I knew there was a basement under that old church, or that mysterious ferry that just kept leaving port, I might have another look. But I wasn’t, so I hung on to my harness and followed Graham further into the building.

Like I said, it was a long way away, and there were a lot fewer people here, but there were more things to explore, and there was less pedestrian traffic; it hardly seemed like there were any other cars on the road. And for an hour we followed GrahamÂs route, going up and down and around one of the floors, until we came to the top, which was like the ceiling in this building. We walked through what I call the Level 3, and judging by the cobwebs lining the inside, it must have been meant for a third level corridor that we just couldn’t see.

And then Graham. We didn’t need to say anything. Just as I had every other time we’d ridden with Paul Noriega. Our first Time on a Greyhound was two weeks ago, and I’d only met Graham a handful of times in person. We were picked up by a British Transport Police officer driving near Preston, and she stopped to give us a ride home. We didn’t get any answer from Graham, and he clearly wasn’t too happy about the whole thing, so when we had a look around we decided to turn a corner and check Level 3.

The street we were heading down was quite a ways away from the building we’d come in from, so we decided to get a hotel and just sit there. We were walking and he was probably chatting away. I was about to ask him to wait a minute or two when I noticed a framed quote, centered around the words:
[EXTENDED SIGH OVER MARTIN AT THE DISTANCE]

“There Is No Such Thing as a False Prophet”

He had been sitting in a café across the street from us. I had decided to ask him a question, and was just about to ask him “Why are you wearing that shirt?” When I heard that strange laugh again I decided I’d have a chat with Graham.

What does it mean? I asked as we talked on in the hopes he might know what was happening, but was still waiting for the right words. When I decided I’m just not in the mood, I asked anyway. He just looked at me, clearly not expecting any answer.

“A False Prophet?” He asked, clearly expecting to hear some variation of the theme. I tried to explain that I’ve lived a very uncompromising life, but I’ve always used my faith to try and balance it. I have always found extremes, and this line of thinking has pushed me further than I could ever have imagined. I don’t know whether this was just amplified perspective or just made me more susceptible to this line of thinking, but I just couldn’t let it go. I looked at Paul Noriega, and I knew what was happening.

I watched it for a few days. It seemed to drag on and on, an inexorable progression, until at last it seemed to have reached an end. I had decided that at some point I’d find out where we went wrong, and I would stop it. I would find the balance between right and wrong, and try to make it right. But as I walked along the path I noticed something. There was… something at the other end, just beyond the edge. An old, wooden handle, dark and cold against the blackened bone. It was long and sharp, and as I got closer I realized it was a hand. And it was cold. I could feel the damp and frigidity on the skin of the hand as I held it.

As I stared at it, my eyes began to adjust. The texture of the skin itself was almost entirely in the shape of a hand, with the rest of the fingers arranged in a fist. It was the size of a regular hand, but as I held it I noticed that it was just filled with tiny bones. Small ones, small dog bones, and crumple mess of bits and pieces. At first I thought they were just bones, but after a few minutes I realized that they were definitely bones. What filled the palm of my hand was an apple, and I ate it.

After that I was done, in almost utter despair. I turned and ran,

 to know that you can’t. Even if I knew how it was, this hadn’t been a place for conversation. This was a dungeon, Matt. In the summer of 2003, I found myself the only Dungeon Master in Brecon, and the only one left in the whole of Kent. It wasn’t the most pleasant place. The other inhabitants were mice, rats, some badger demons - all kinds. They would rub and claw at each other, and dash and howl whenever provoked. If you’d asked me to describe it, I might give away the whole point of hiding, but in the end I shined a spotlight onto the place, and the mice fled or collapsed on the furniture.

I was not at liberty to leave the table, of course. Matt heard a scream, and leapt to his feet. The troll, that he had heard before, was now actively bashed in several places, not least the troll on the table. The smell became musk, in the faint dampness of the floorboards. He grabbed a hammer, and, with Kyle at his quivering best, started to head towards the door.

It was unlocked, of course. Presumably the troll had found him, and gone in to finish his suicide. He would return fire, hopefully crippling the beast before it could pull the trigger. Then he’d pull the trigger himself.

As he charged towards Kyle, he passed right by the door, but what he saw instead was a small army of tiny, scurrying legs. Some raised their heads, some bowed their bodies, and a whole horde vanished into the darkness.

It was slower than the charging mob, and much less deliberate, save for those that made their haste to avoid the gaze of the troll. As the troll closed around him, Matt took aim. The shot missed, but as the troll turned sideways it seemed as though Matt had made a deliberate decision. Perhaps the collapsing corpse could be salvaged?

Or perhaps it was simply a sign of things to come.

As he fired his salvaging knife, he felt an arcing pain in his right arm. Why? He had been trying to remove the finger, that had been infected by the marauding legs. Had he been aiming for the skull? Perhaps, but he hesitated, as though weighing the options. Then, without warning, he felt a sudden pain in his left arm, and looked down to see the stump of his shattered finger protruding from the amputated stump. He screamed, and fell to the floor.

After that it was all a bit of blur. I-I thought I was going to die. End recording.

Oh. Oh, no, no…

ELIAS

Martin. My patron is very important to me. It’s not enough to doom me forever. You need to make sure she’s never alone. So I’ve been working very hard to make sure she doesn’t lose anyone.

[MARTIN INHALES.]
Toothless folk tend to isolate themselves from others, but not from themselves. That kind of… loneliness is very bad for anyone. I try to bring that anxiety out in them. So many people, they act normal, they normalize the isolation. But it doesn’t help them. And it doesn’t help them live a normal life.

I knew when I started seeing the strings that were pulling them, the unknown forces that were bringing them together, that this wasn’t normal.

Elias probably figured as much, I think, and he was working very hard to keep the place under wraps. But it was getting harder and harder to keep the whole world in suspension while Isabel was doing her work.

I guess, just like with my mum, it’s all a bit surreal.

Statement of Sampson Kempthorne, regarding his career as a mail carrier. Original statement given December 3rd, 1910. Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, Head Archivist of the Magnus Institute, London.

Statement begins.
ARCHIVIST

I’ve been in the shipping business for about forty years now, and I can tell you from experience that the first journey is always the hardest. The logistics and training involved are staggering, and the company you work for is almost always small enough that you can fill up and drop off any items you’re ordered. But even on the best of teams, it’s always going to be the first time anything’s gone missing. That said, I’m happily employed at the moment, so it’s down to me to get the items to whoever it is that sent them. It’s not a problem, really, because I know exactly where they’re going.

It’s a sadistic profession, but I always used to treat it as a sport. Whenever I found myself out of the country, whether it was on business, or just because the courier was on holiday, I always made a point to take them out for a quick lunch, and get their shipping containers ready for a trip.

It’s not that easy, of course. I mean, I’ve got a ton of experience carrying things for companies bigger than I, and if I had that much weight to carry, maybe I wouldn’t be doing it at all. But a long way from normal, creeping over to the wrong company or stupidly labelled post?

I’ve also got a pretty substantial following, especially following the sort of thing they keep ordering online. People

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 Above the bed, there were new footprints. Thick, thorny footprints. I couldn’t see where they came from, but every time those footprints began to appear, or where my foot almost touched the hard-packed earth, there was a sound of a car engine - whether it was Old Faithful or a Triumph T12.

Before that, there were fewer than a dozen of them, but as I went up the stairs, I heard the sound of movement from the bedroom. At first I thought it might have been John or something, but every so often a different person would emerge, and the sound would change again, becoming muffled or missing altogether. I never got a good look, but I believe it to have happened sometime in the last week.

I’m glad I decided to turn around, as it seemed to open the door wide enough for me to walk calmly inside. The place was already starting to get quite warm, and the wooden floors gave way to a soft carpet of pale, damp fur. There wasn’t anything else to do, so I decided to go up the stairs.

It was easier than I’d been hoping. The house was in a good shape, and the carpet seemed untouched. The only thing I noticed that wasn’t in the way was the size of the door. It was… unusual, made of thick board, and slightly warped. I’m not sure how sturdy the thing was, but it didn’t seem broken. It was just as warm as the carpet had been, though, and the paint was still mostly new.

I was just about to walk over and join them, when I noticed the time. I had barely got back up to where I’d stopped when I saw it. It was… almost half an hour before I was due to return. And all the walls and floors had been covered in what I assumed were beetles. At first I thought they were dead, but each burst to life at the sight of my presence. Within seconds I could feel myself falling off the platform and spilling my guts. I staggered to my feet and began to make my way towards the door.

It was unlocked. I guessed the adults had come in during the daytime to get rid of anything that might have attracted my attention. I reached up and turned it, and almost expected the light to break as I touched the switch. Instead, a rich, velvety scent passed through me as I turned the corner. Familiar faces stood there, seemingly unmoving, wearing cheap T-shirts and laughing without speaking. I decided to ignore them and continue onwards.

It was… odd, but even with the intense scent of bugs around, there was something compelling about the whole thing. I didn’t approach them or speak to them, I just continued forward. At a certain point I decided I needed to take a photograph. I was going to make a record of it.

My camera was running out of battery life and I was thinking about quitting. I had only had one shot, and all the others were clearly of questionable quality. I was planning to leave as soon as it ran out. That was when I got jumpier than I had ever seen.

I chased it for almost a mile before I finally decided to turn around and run back the way I came. It was almost impossible to retrace my steps because the screen was covered in spiders, so I instead turned around and began to chase it again. And then I got to the end of the street. I could have retraced my route, but that would have required moving at such a fast clip that there was almost no way I was going to keep up, everything criss-crossing and weaving through each other until I found the corner.

It was almost a mile before I felt a pull on my leg. I leaned over to see what was going on, and sure enough there it was a thin, dark shape moving down the road. The thing was almost impossible to see, but it was huge, so big that it seemed like it weighed about as much as a normal car.

Its size was clearly something of a surprise. I’m not a terrific photographer and even I was finding it hard to focus on any single frame with any clarity. Even with the flash, framing it was hard to get a solid shot of it, and as I tried, I realised that it didn’t seem to be focusing on anything.

So I crouched down on the tarmac and started to walk back the way I had come. Maybe this place was just a bit more unnerving than I thought.

I slowly headed back towards my car, refusing to stop as I saw a figure approaching. At first I thought it was a construction worker, but then I realized that it was a man. He was stood there, just across the street, watching me. His face was totally expressionless,

That’s… what?

ARCHIVIST
A while back, I was going to give Basira a call.

…

You didn’t want to answer my questions, did you?

DAISY
[Distorted] No! Why would I want to know that!?

ARCHIVIST
Well, you came for me, didn’t you?

DAISY
Oh, well, maybe you didn’t want to hear it either.

ARCHIVIST
Well, I’m still not exactly clear what’s going on.

DAISY
Well, you’re the Detective now.

ARCHIVIST
Daisy’s been good, but I’ve got a few cases to get after, so I’m, I’m busy enough.

DAISY
You sure you want to take this on?

ARCHIVIST
It’s not about the money.

DAISY
Well, then why bother?

ARCHIVIST
Well, you’re the Detective now.

DAISY
Yeah, give it up for the banana skin, I guess.

ARCHIVIST
No… I mean, it is what it is. It’s not your fault; it wasn’t even a holiday.

DAISY
Yeah, well, if you’re not careful you could be getting yourself something very special indeed.

ARCHIVIST
Right.

DAISY
If you’re quick enough to stay out of sight for once, you can be forgiven, I suppose.

ARCHIVIST
You’re right, I suppose.

DAISY
If you stumble across any more skeletal remains, do let me know.

ARCHIVIST
Thank you, Detective Tonner. I will.

DAISY
You’re too polite.

ARCHIVIST
Maybe I was just being observant.

DAISY
For the record, I’m sorry if it does anything to your relationship.

ARCHIVIST
Well, I wouldn’t hold it against you.

DAISY
It’s fine.

ARCHIVIST
Any questions?

DAISY
Yeah. How did you know I sent you to the Cambridge Military Hospital?

ARCHIVIST
I, er, you wouldn’t know.

DAISY
No. I would never knowingly send anyone to the wrong hospital.

ARCHIVIST
Well, you’re certainly welcome to try.

DAISY
You’re really going to burn the place down, then?

ARCHIVIST
If you’re right about it, of course.

DAISY
[Sigh] You’re really not going to give me a straight answer like that, are you?

ARCHIVIST
I mean, I wouldn’t have to.

DAISY
Well, you’re definitely better than that.

ARCHIVIST
What, are you going to lean on me for answers

 a statement of a man dying, given directly to the bot.

The script was quite simple. It just asked the question, “Who is Gertrude”, whatever the bot thought might be, and the bot would give you a response, like you were reading it. There was no back-and-forth, no middle-of-the-road or ambiguity in the question. Just, erm, dead simple.

And there was a lot of it. Gertrude could respond to questions in a hundred different ways, and the bot would give you a solid, yes or no, answer in as many. There was nothing in there. Not a single thing to tell the bot to get over its inherent stupidity.

The problem was the middle. The problem was the line at the bottom of the page. It was a dead end. There was nothing but a sharp, pointed end to the line, and the only thing between it and the very end was a very thin, chalked-on barrier, which the bot would try to reach using only its hands.

I asked Elias, who generally deals with these sorts of things, if he’d had any similar experiences, if he thought there might be some magic, and he looked out into the crowd of people who worked there, saw somebody slumped in the corner next to him, and started to explain what the issue was. I’m sure I don’t need to tell you how angry he got when he saw it.

Andrew tried to chat with the old woman, but their talking came out very loud. She yelped once or twice, then shook her head and left. I tried to talk to Elias about it, and he did seem a little bit unnerved by it, but he didn’t seem to be able to do anything except sigh and hand me his business card, which I took. Tried to find out what the issue was with the bot, and it was then that I noticed something else that bothered me. Although I didn’t immediately think anything of it, I knew something was wrong. The page had been mapped onto a child’s birthday card, with pictures of the girl on it. The card was labelled “Mummy”, the year and the month had been disheveled, and there was a Starburst on it, which I counted at three hundred and fifty-two cards. The picture of the smiling baby’s face that seemed to appear next to the card was drawn in the centre of each one of those cards, like a star pattern, and it was far too dark to just be a picture of the person who drew the card. I didn’t have much time to really think about it before that, as my phone was drawing itself to call.

I heard the phone ring twice. The first time it was just silence, punctuated only by the occasional whistle or the occasionally drifting of a nearby ship. My gaze drifted upwards, where the ship was waiting. I couldn’t see where the other end of the ship would end, I couldn’t reach it. It was only after a few seconds that I saw it, the side of the ship getting smaller and smaller, its prow just a hair away from the deck. I heard something from the ship, and it was a long exhale, coming from the captain, a voice that sounded raspy and tired. It was hard to tell if it was him, to be honest. The guy was a real asshole.

He told us we still had the crew to spare, that they’d catch the kid breaking the ship’s hull, and that they’d be in touch with his guardian, who would of course claim the kid was too violent for the ocean. Rotten! Rotten! I actually thought he was going to say something, so I agreed to go with him as a backup. Rotten! Rotten!

There were two other crewmembers on the deck, a big guy with close-cropped hair and a skinny kid with close-cropped hair, both of them were wearing dark suits, so it didn’t take long for us to meet them. I remember I spied one of them watching the old man, but he was too quiet to notice. Once the kid was gone, the old man and his friend seemed to make up their minds, and headed towards the door to the captain’s cabin. I didn’t see any of them back down the stairs, and at the time I really didn’t care; I was too busy trying not to think about the goddamn door.

The captain led them both into a small office on the side of the ship, and they sat down on a bench behind the desk. The old man was still bent over in his chair, but he seemed at least a little bit comforted; I could

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 I want it to be like old school text adventures… you don’t get that with a CGI blockbuster. But I get that a computer can dream.

I don’t like to plan. I don’t like to construct. But the more I think about it, the more I believe that there’s something in these little hooks that can make any plan pointless. Just a click or a fade away. If I know when to use it, it will only get more intricate. And when I do, the rewards are… always something new.

I always try to avoid pre-planning. I always err on the side of caution, of not just trusting what I can see, but actually knowing it. So I always have a plan.

Sometimes, though, I just don’t know how I’m going to do it. And that feels… really bad.

Well, to be honest, I always expected George to scold me for wasting his time. But he never did. Not until I actually saw him do it.

For the most part, my little ones enjoyed their escapist escapades without any real danger. But there would always be a few that I couldn’t handle. And that was when I would probably tell them to go away.

They were most likely to do that when I was around Walt Disney World, so that was always a possibility. And when I saw him, I would sometimes see those same floating eyes following me, subtly following me wherever I went.

I was never quite as clever as him, though. At least, I feel I was. I forget, I mean, I was pretty smart, but there was a part of me that always knew that if I didn’t like something, I was just going to leave it. And if that meant I had to spend a day at the beach with Skip and a bunch of ping pong balls, then I would have to go.

There was one other time, maybe during the winter, I was going on a trip to the Botanical Gardens. I was bored at not enough puzzles to keep my interest, and I was bored at not being bored. So often there were just… enough.

So I was at the right place at the right time. I was on a flight home, having just finished my first job as a correspondent for The Observer, and I wanted to get out of that place as soon as possible. So when I spotted - or maybe I was just the lead - that there was going to be a small opening at the back of the hotel, I decided to take a leak.

It was dry inside, and the air was cool with a thin mist of sand near the door, but it was still pretty much pitch-black, so I decided to wait. I was probably going to make a stink of myself later, when the last of the light filtered through from a broken window.

The room was cool, and I had an umbrella to protect myself from the chill, but I still felt the creeping feeling of… darknessiness, like something was in there, watching me.

I pulled out my little torch and shone it at the wall, and sure enough, as the light reflected off the pitted barrier, I could see a long, thin hallway leading off into an under-darkened room. The light from the torch hit the wall behind me, and I began to realise how dark it was. There was no light from the torch, but the darkness seemed far too dark for me, even in daylight.

I turned to face towards the door, and sure enough, as the path light reflected back my footsteps, I saw it, at least, there was a door. It looked old and made me feel weird, like it was just a regular old wooden door, and not something special. I couldn’t make out any words, and I seemed to be breathing a lot faster than normal, which was making me feel very unsettled. I don’t remember much after that.

I spent a lot of time at the bottom of the stairs, and I realised that I could smell cigarettes from up ahead. I walked down, and my legs were shaking again. I tried to ignore it, as the darkening air felt odd in my face, but I couldn’t get past it. So I waited, trying to entice the dimmer switch to turn on.

At some point, I must have been almost at the top, because the lights came back on. The whole hotel was quiet, and my night had really begun. I checked the time, and it was now just before 11pm. I was very tired, and very aware that I was going to need to sit down and wait for some time, but even so I went to my room to lay in my bed. I was just about to go to sleep, when a woman came in

 completion.

GERTRUDE
Yes, well. (shaky inhale) That doesn’t exactly help the situation.

[PAUSE.]
ERIC
Still, I wasn’t gonna force it. If you do that, I don’t know what would happen. (brief pause) Anyway, if you’re just on the outside, nothin’s come up to save you? (pause) Nothing worth dying for. (bitter laugh) Still, I wanted to at least give ya something.

GERTRUDE
Uh, yes. Well. It’s, uh, it’s pretty much the same deal, you know. I mean, there’s, it’s pretty much the same world as I do. Probably more so - (she swallows) But y’know, it’s a world of dirty, terrible things. And, and some of that’s just as well, in my case. I mean, some of it’s not too bad.

[ERIC INHALES IT SOON.]
Still, it’s tiring to see the state that we’re in. (bitter laugh) A lot of people get worked up about it, too busy trying to avoid or negotiate with the Extinction. (cough) But it’s no different - no more bodies, no suffering, no loss of life that’s not worth another bruised lip. (bitter laugh) Not that I’m particularly qualified to say what the state of the world needs from us, not really. (cough) We just need to work harder to stay alive.

GERTRUDE
Hm. Well. If we keep doing the same things, maybe we don’t need to do so much different. We could be more aligned, I think.

ERIC
It’s not even our fault. Any time there’s a rift, there’s a, a tension, and we’re the ones who get caught in it.

GERTRUDE
Trouble is, I sometimes worry that the kind of thing we’re already (bitter laugh) destined to be - one of the reasons I chose to be a Detective.

ERIC
That’s one way to put it. Another is that I don’t really feel like it. Journals can be quite a lonely craft.

GERTRUDE
I’ve overheard a few conversations in the Detective section of the archives where people’re like that. Some old, some fresh off the boat, and some – never quite the same person twice. (sighs) But for the most part they try to think things through, and, you know, die alone. It’s the most honest I’ve ever heard.

ERIC
It’s also why I’m here, in some ways. I tried to get out of the business, a lot of pain, but it’s what we do, and sometimes that’s not enough. Sometimes it’s not even us doing it, but it’s the world we live in, y’know, where the tortured, lonely, dead ends.

GERTRUDE
Agent Orange.

ERIC
Yeah. Exactly. Used it as an aphrodisiac, back in the day. Not quite as strong as, but still, quite alkaline. Used to get a lot of comments from elderly people about how they missed the boat, y’know, the old people who thought it was too cold to live upon. But it’s just a very deliberate, very deliberate avoidance of the things that are poisoning us. (sigh) I mean, walking down the A41, I can almost guarantee that there’s somebody under the stairs at some point. (coughs) And there’s always the odd jogger, or, or skydiver, or, or pole vaulter, but no, I’m not sure that’s it.

Sometimes, I feel like something needs to be done. It’s not an official TFL thing, but I’ve heard it enough to be safe. We’ve had enough poles overturned, and too many broken bottles, to the point where, in the old days, having a faulty screw replaced was quite literally a medical emergency. (sigh) But I don’t know if I need to.

ERIC
Know what, no? That’s - I’ve been thinking. This is the second time you’ve turned up, both of you. Last time I went to the cemetery with my parents,

 move from them.

ARCHIVIST
Uh – (slight pause) …why are you here?

MELANIE
I took someone.

ARCHIVIST
Oh, uh, Martin, uh, took Matthew, uh, Bree, he took Debbie. Oh, uh, lightning struck again, but I guess it, uh, didn’t go as badly as I - (slight pause)

MELANIE
(overlapping) Oh! Sorry, I thought you were following me.

ARCHIVIST
Well, uh, that’s, uh… that’s not - I-I don’t think I have anything to say to you, pal.

[UNFORTUNATELY FOR BOTH OF THEM, THE ARCHIVIST’S SIGNATURE STATIC RATTLEES LOW IN THE BACKGROUND AS HE SPEAKS.]
MELANIE
What can you do to help?

ARCHIVIST
You know how sabotaging me is going to help, right? I just need to make sure Elias doesn’t, um, accidentally end the world.

MELANIE
Yes, I suppose that you would.

[THE ARCHIVIST SIGHS.]
MELANIE
Or at least, weaken it.

ARCHIVIST
And you just - you don’t know how. You don’t know where or when it is, and I can’t tell if you’re helping or hurting him. There is no way I can save everyone if I don’t know what I’m doing.

MELANIE
And you just want to talk to me about it?

ARCHIVIST
Sure. How’s your behaviour been?

MELANIE
I don’t know! I’m mean, I’m quiet, but I think it’s because I’m well-fed, I guess? I’ve always been the opposite to what the others are: greedy, like I need others in danger to be satisfied.

ARCHIVIST
Hmm. Sounds like you need help.

MELANIE
Yeah. Heh, I’ve been saving up for a while, so I get nervous whenever I see one. Even when I know it’s not the real Debbie. I look at you, your blank eyes betray a hunger as well. Look at him, you know? You meet the eye of all five senses, and you only got back from the brink of death once. You’ve got to realise, I feel like you’re watching me all the time. I mean, we’re not friends, but close.

ARCHIVIST
What about the others? If they turn up, can you just delete them?

MELANIE
It’s not, I promise you won’t get your precious thing back.

ARCHIVIST
:(sighs) Mhm.

Last I heard, you were working on something with Lukas.

MELANIE
Yep. [Sigh] I thought you said he was a Lukas impersonator.

ARCHIVIST
That is, assuming he’s not a real person.

MELANIE
I mean, it wouldn’t hurt, but it would help. And, you know, it actually worked for me once. I got all the ducks in a row.

ARCHIVIST
You don’t still think about that?

MELANIE
Yeah. I used to think, you know. The way I see it, there’s only once you get past the initial grin off the faces of the teachers that I start to get real concerns. Like, oh, are you going to pull this stunt?

So I thought, of course, and sent an e-mail to Tim and Sasha. I’ve, I’ve got all the other professors onside, but I still feel like I’m getting squeezed. Like I’m being moved around too much.

ARCHIVIST
Oh, I, uh - I mean, that’s not - I -

MELANIE
Yeah. That is definitely happening. Er, and, and it’s messing with the Archives, isn’t it? I - I keep thinking, looking out, like - there’s something really weird and I don’t know how I can leave it.

ARCHIVIST
E-Elias knows what happened, right?

MELANIE
Yeah. And he’s managed to do something about it, so - I thought

 upon me and my eyes began to go wide.

Suddenly, I was surrounded by that familiar cracked sound and the realization of what was happening hit me like a wave. I tried to leave with the knowledge that I was in the tunnels, but some part of me refused to allow that.

I was still trying to figure out what was going on, not wanting to be trapped down here, but I had this feeling of being watched, and I couldn’t ignore it.

At first it was as I thought up a plan of attack. By this point I was just trying to process what I was feeling, but as the seconds turned into minutes and the number of lights turned from countless to one hundred, I began to panic.

I wanted to come out of this like I had in the first place, but something stopped me.

When I finally found my feet, I was still deep in the grip of that wooden box, and that sound was still clear in my mind.

I broke and ran from that house. I ran out of the house, back to the hostel, and then I didn’t return to the hostel. I had a bad feeling about what was going to happen and I tried to ignore it, but that wooden box was just a part of it.

As the days turned into weeks and the number of lights in the house decreased, I started to wait. I didn’t return to the hostel until the tenth day, and that was when things began to… slowly change.

I saw the lights at the back of the house began to blink, and the shadows cast by the dim streetlamps were almost as faint as the lights themselves.

There were fewer and fewer of them each night. I watched them shift and… I began to sweat.

I did not go to the hostel that night. I had plans to report Hartley’s disappearance the next day, and compile a list of all the people who had watched him, but I had… I had other things to report.

On the list was Diego Molina, the lightless bassist. I had been in possession of his music for almost two decades when Diego disappeared in Obregon in April 2002. No one had seen him alive five months after his disappearance. No one had heard from him since he vanished.

I had tried to follow his… disappearance to its cause, but I had insufficient evidence to make any headway. As a result, I filed a rather feeble complaint about his passing.

I discovered he had been killed, however. By who or what was unknown. I have no idea.

I believe the attack was linked to a string of bad reviews that had been given to Sonnenschein Studios, a particular studio which had been selected for the sort of disaster that had befallen Sonnenschein.
